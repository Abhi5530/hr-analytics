## Problem Statement :-

1. HR wanted to understand the working preferences of employees in her company (work from home / work from office).
2. How is present percentage of people effected monthly or daily.  
3. On what days are people more interested in working from home and office and what could be reason behind it.
4. how frequently do people take sick leave and on what days.

Solution :- 
1. Data available was in excel format. It was loaded into PowerBI and some transformations were made to clean and fit the data according to needs.
2. Transformed data was then used to create some measures using DAX(data analysis expression). using these measures the dashboard presented below was created.

Dashboard provide a visual representation of various HR metrics like employee retention rates, recruitment analytics, how seasonality effects working preference of employees, on what days are most of employees present and on what not. These analysis metrics can help stakeholders make meaningful decisions like renting space cost reduction , when to take meetings. Who has the highest present percentage among all employees etc.
